## License Identifier

You have to start with a SPDX License Identifier at the top of your solidity file.

`// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`

We use [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT) in the license name because it is granted free-of-charge and without restrictions.

## Pragma 
We use pragma to define the solidity verison

```solidity 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
// Anything above 0.8.0

pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
// Anything between 0.8.0 to 0.9.0 where 0.9.0 is not included.

pragma solidity 0.8.8;
// Only Version 0.8.8
```
## Comments

## Contract Structure 

Solidityâ€™s code is encapsulated in contracts which means a contract in Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. A contract is a fundamental block of building an application on Ethereum. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-smart-contract-in-solidity/)

```solidity
contract ContractName {

}
```
While naming the contract it is considered best practice to Capitalize the first Letter and use CamelCase.
